## Qeats Social Review.
### Micro Experience Introduction

The most requested feature on QEats is the ability to share reviews on past orders on QEats' social media pages. Users want to click a photo of the orders they have received, write eye-catching captions and add relevant tags to make their reviews easily discoverable. 

In this Mini-Project, we have created QEats Reviews page on various social media sites. A series REST APIs were used to post user-submitted reviews to the QEats Reviews pages. Finally, a hosted AI-powered classifier was utilized to suggest relevant review hashtags.
